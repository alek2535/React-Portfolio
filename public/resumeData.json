They checked in with me often to let me know the status and their development process to make sure there werenâ€™t any issues with their plan, which proved him to be a dependable colleague. When the code was delivered, I was impressed to see how well-structured and easy-to-read it was. It also used all ES6 features, which I believe shows them to be quick learners. During our time working together, the team have been very persistent in asking for feedback. I believe this persistence, passion, and curiosity prove that all of them would be a great asset to any team. And with the right guidance and training, I have no doubt they could excel in a higher-level development position.",
